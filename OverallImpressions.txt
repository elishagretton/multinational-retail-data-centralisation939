Overall:

This is an absolutely brilliant project, all code has been documented correctly, code is clear & consise. Exceptions have been
handeled throughout your classes, the ipynb notebooks allow views to see the effects of your cleaning operations. 
Its clear you have put alot of thought into the structure of this project with lots of nice details throughout which I have
added #NOTE above to make comments on them! On a side not also including a requirements.txt is a lovely final touch!

README: This README is near perfect. You have clearly outlined the aims of the project as an industry application.
alongside that your installation instructions are clear & show an keen understanding of software development.
The only portions to add here:
    - A list of key tools used: when employers view this project immediately you can advertise your tech-stack even 
    before they've viewed the project in detail
    - At the moment your SQL Query results cannot be seen by users, you should include these in the README or in a seperate
    file, this could be either a document or a .ipynb

SQL: All of you SQL table alterations are neatly organised based on table, the queries are all perfect & jusst need the added 
outputs featured.
